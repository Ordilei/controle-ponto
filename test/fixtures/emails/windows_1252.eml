Dear Natalie,

Happy New Year......although can you believe a month has gone =20
already!!!!!

Natalie, help please.  I have not been filling out the certificate =20
completion to advise that the qualification is completed.  So our =20
students even though they have finished are still showing as active.  =20=

Is this a requirement for AVETMISS (NAT 130 file).

Can you please advise if this is what we need to do to show the =20
students have completed and are no longer active?  Does the =20
information transfer from the outcomes already added?

Cheers,

Kerry
